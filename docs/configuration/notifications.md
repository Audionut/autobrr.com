# Notifications

autobrr has built in support for notification agents.

## Discord

To set up notifications for Discord head to the `settings/notifications` tab.

1. Click `add new`
2. Pick Discord in the `type` drop down menu and give it a name
3. Choose between the events `Push Rejected`, `Push Approved` or `Push Error`

> You can enable all in the same agent or create separate agents for separate events.

4. Add your Webhook URL which you can find in your Discord channel's settings tab.

> Webhook URLs are created in Discord. Go to `Server Settings` in your Discord room and click `Integrations` followed by `Webhooks`. Click `New Webhook` and follow the steps.
