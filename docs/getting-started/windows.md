import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

In this setup we will create an autobrr user and a Windows service that operates in the background. This way we won't need to have a command prompt window open 24/7.

## Download package

Download the latest Windows release and unpack. Place everything in `C:\.autobrr` or some other directory.

Latest release can always be found at:

```bash
https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr/releases/latest
```

## Create config

Create a config folder within autobrr like `C:\.autobrr\.config`.

Add config:

```toml title="config.toml"
# Hostname / IP
#
# Default: "localhost"
#
host = "127.0.0.1"

# Port
#
# Default: 7474
#
port = 7474

# Base url
# Set custom baseUrl eg /autobrr/ to serve in subdirectory.
# Not needed for subdomain, or by accessing with the :port directly.
#
# Optional
#
#baseUrl = "/autobrr/"

# autobrr logs file
# If not defined, logs to stdout
#
# Optional
#
#logPath = "log/autobrr.log"

# Log level
#
# Default: "DEBUG"
#
# Options: "ERROR", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN"
#
logLevel = "TRACE"

# Session secret
# Can be generated by running: head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c16
sessionSecret = "secret-session-key"
```

### Config options

* `host`: If not using a reverse proxy, change to `0.0.0.0`.
* `port`: If port already in use then change to a free one.
* `baseUrl`: **`OPTIONAL`** It supports running on both the root url and in a subpath, as well as subdomain. Uncomment if needed.
* `logPath`: **`OPTIONAL`** It can be useful to log to file. If running with systemd you can use `journalctl` to check logs. It has built in logrotation to not fill up disk.
* `logLevel`: Choose how much log output you want to see. Needs a restart to take effect.
* `sessionSecret`: Used for session cookies. Change to something more random like a `UUID`.

## Create autobrr user

If you skip this step you won't be able to login to Autobrr, so lets quickly get a user made.

Inside the autobrr folder, **hold shift and right click** on an empty area. You can then see **Open PowerShell window here**. Yours might say Command Prompt.

Enter

```cmd
.\autobrrctl.exe --config . create-user USER
```

Make sure you replace with USER with the username you want. Enter a password and that's it. Lets create a new service.

## Create windows task

Press your windows key and search for **Task Scheduler** and lets **Create basic task**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/a.%20create%20basic%20task.png')} />

Add a name, this will show up in the Task Scheduler. Feel free to add the Autorbrr description if you'd like.

> Autobrr monitors IRC announce channels to get releases as soon as they are available with good filtering.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/b.%20name%20task.png')} />

Next you'll set a **Trigger** which we want to start as soon as we **login to the computer**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/c.%20trigger.png')} />

Our Action will be to **Start a Program** and we'll set our path to the autobrr.exe. Just click **Browse** and navigate to where you put your **autobrr.exe**

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/d.%20action.png')} />

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/e.%20path%20to%20autobrr.png')} />

Our final step is to **Run whether user is logged on or not** After you set this it'll prompt you for the windows administrator password. Enter it and you should be ready to run.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/f.%20properties.png')} />

And we're done, a windows service has been created. Now right click on Autobrr in the list and click **Run.**

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/g.%20service%20created.png')} />

:::tip

If you need to ever restart the service, within Task Scheduler you can click on End and Run on the right side bar.
