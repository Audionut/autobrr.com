# Installation <FaLinux />

Welcome to the autobrr installation walkthrough!
Follow these steps and we will have you up and running in no time.

Follow instructions below for recommended setup on a regular linux server.  
For docker and Windows, see our [docker <FaDocker />](/getting-started/docker) and [windows <FaWindows />](/getting-started/windows) installation instructions.

## swizzin

For swizzin users, simply run:

```bash
sudo box install autobrr
```

Remember to head over to our [Configuration Guide](/configuration/indexers) and set up your indexers, IRC, and download clients when you're ready.

## Regular installation

### Download package

Download the latest release, or download [source](https://github.com/autobrr/autobrr/releases/latest) and build yourself.

```bash
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/autobrr/autobrr/releases/latest | grep download | grep linux_x86_64 | cut -d\" -f4)
```

### Unpack

Run with `root` or `sudo`. If you do not have root, or are on a shared system, place the binaries somewhere in your home directory like `~/.bin`.

```bash
tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf autobrr_0.23.1_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

This will extract both `autobrr` and `autobrrctl` to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Create config

Create a config directory in your users home directory like `~/.config/autobrr`.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autobrr && touch ~/.config/autobrr/config.toml
```

#### Add config

```toml
# config.toml

# Hostname / IP
#
# Default: "localhost"
#
host = "127.0.0.1"

# Port
#
# Default: 7474
#
port = 7474

# Base url
# Set custom baseUrl eg /autobrr/ to serve in subdirectory.
# Not needed for subdomain, or by accessing with the :port directly.
#
# Optional
#
#baseUrl = "/autobrr/"

# autobrr logs file
# If not defined, logs to stdout
#
# Optional
#
#logPath = "log/autobrr.log"

# Log level
#
# Default: "DEBUG"
#
# Options: "ERROR", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN"
#
logLevel = "TRACE"

# Session secret
# Can be generated by running: head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c16
sessionSecret = "secret-session-key"
```

#### Config options

- `host`: If not using a reverse proxy, change to `0.0.0.0`.
- `port`: If port already in use then change to a free one.
- `baseUrl`: **`OPTIONAL`** It supports running on both the root url and in a subpath, as well as subdomain. Uncomment if needed.
- `logPath`: **`OPTIONAL`** It can be useful to log to file. If running with systemd you can use `journalctl` to check logs. It has built in log rotation to not fill up disk.
- `logLevel`: Choose how much log output you want to see. Needs a restart to take effect.
- `sessionSecret`: Used for session cookies. Change to something more random like a `UUID`.

## Create user

To create the initial database and a user, you need to use `autobrrctl`. Point `--config` to your config directory, and set username to your desired one. It will ask for password.

```bash
autobrrctl --config ~/.config/autobrr create-user USERNAME
```

### Systemd

This is the recommended way to run autobrr on linux based systems.

Create a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/` called `autobrr.service`.

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/autobrr.service
```

Then fill it with the following service definition

```systemd title="/etc/systemd/system/autobrr.service"
[Unit]
Description=autobrr service for username
After=syslog.target network-online.target
[Service]
Type=simple
User=username
Group=username
ExecStart=/usr/bin/autobrr --config=/home/username/.config/autobrr/
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service. Enable will make it startup on reboot.

```bash
systemctl enable -q --now autobrr
```

## Reverse proxy

It's recommended to run it behind a reverse proxy like nginx to get TLS and all that good stuff.

This is an nginx example that should work for most:

```nginx
location /autobrr/ {
    proxy_pass              http://$remote_user.autobrr;
    proxy_http_version      1.1;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Host        $http_host;

    auth_basic "What's the password?";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/htpasswd;

    rewrite ^/autobrr/(.*) /$1 break;
}
```

## Done

Now it's up and running, and you should be able to visit it at your `domain.ltd:7474` and login. Check out the next pages for further setup.
