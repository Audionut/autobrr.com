# Shared seedbox

These are instructions and installation scripts for shared seedboxes. We have support for a couple of providers out of the box and if yours are missing then please write on Discord so we add support.

The scripts requires some input but does most of the work.

Additionally see our installation instructions for [Linux <FaLinux />](/installation/linux), [Docker <FaDocker />](/installation/docker) and [windows <FaWindows />](/installation/windows).

import SeedboxInstallers from '/snippets/seedbox-installers.mdx';

<SeedboxInstallers />

Note: Remember to head over to our [Configuration Guide](/configuration/indexers) to learn how to set up your indexers, IRC, and download clients after you're done installing.
